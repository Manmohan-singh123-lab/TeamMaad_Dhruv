In communication systems, particularly frequency modulation (FM) and analog audio transmission, the signal is often affected by noise, especially at higher frequencies. To mitigate this issue and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a technique involving pre-emphasis and de-emphasis is employed.


### 1. Pre-emphasis:

Pre-emphasis refers to the process of boosting the amplitude of high-frequency components of a signal before transmission. This is done because:

High-frequency signals are more vulnerable to noise interference.

Noise tends to be more prominent in the higher-frequency spectrum.

A pre-emphasis circuit is essentially a high-pass filter or differentiator, implemented using a simple RC (resistor-capacitor) network. It increases the gain for frequencies above a certain cutoff, allowing the important high-frequency components of the signal to stand out against noise.

The standard time constant (τ) used in pre-emphasis is:

75 µs in North America

50 µs in Europe and other regions

This time constant defines the frequency response of the filter:

f_c = 1 / (2 * π * R * C)


### 2. De-emphasis:

At the receiver end, de-emphasis is used to reverse the effect of pre-emphasis. It reduces the high-frequency components in the received signal back to their original level, effectively suppressing any high-frequency noise that was added during transmission.

The de-emphasis circuit is a low-pass filter or integrator with the same time constant used in the pre-emphasis stage. It ensures that:

The overall frequency response of the system is flat.

The high-frequency noise is attenuated, improving audio clarity.

### 3. Combined Effect:

When used together:

Pre-emphasis boosts high-frequency signal components at the transmitter.

De-emphasis attenuates those same frequencies at the receiver.

This technique results in an overall improvement in audio quality, especially under noisy channel conditions, by minimizing the effect of additive high-frequency noise.


### 4. Practical Applications:

FM radio broadcasting

Analog audio recording

Telecommunication systems

Magnetic tape recording and playback

These circuits are implemented using RC networks and are critical in systems where noise immunity and signal fidelity are important. The experiment demonstrates the frequency-selective behavior of these circuits and their role in real-world communication systems.
