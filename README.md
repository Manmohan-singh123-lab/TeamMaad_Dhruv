### About the Experiment 
Pre-emphasis and de-emphasis are techniques used in communication systems to improve signal quality by managing noise. Pre-emphasis boosts the amplitude of high-frequency components before transmission to combat high-frequency noise. At the receiver end, de-emphasis attenuates these boosted frequencies back to their original level, reducing the amplified noise. This process improves the overall signal-to-noise ratio, especially in FM systems. The circuits use RC filters: a high-pass filter for pre-emphasis and a low-pass filter for de-emphasis. This experiment demonstrates how these circuits alter signal strength and shape, effectively enhancing audio transmission quality over noisy communicationÂ channels.
